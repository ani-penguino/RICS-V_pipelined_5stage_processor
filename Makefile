# ---- Introduction ---- #
##########################

# Welcome to the Project 3 VeriSimpleV Processor makefile!
# this file will build and run a fully synthesizable RISC-V verilog processor
# and is an extended version of the EECS 470 standard makefile

# NOTE: this file should need no changes for project 3
# but it will be reused for project 4, where you will likely add your own new files and functionality

# reference table of all make targets:

# make  <- runs the default target, set explicitly below as 'make no_hazard.out'
.DEFAULT_GOAL = no_hazard.out
# ^ this overrides using the first listed target as the default

# ---- Program Execution ---- #
# these are your main commands for running programs and generating output
# make <my_program>.out      <- run a program on simv and generate .out, .wb, and .ppln files in 'output/'
# make <my_program>.syn.out  <- run a program on syn_simv and do the same
# make simulate_all          <- run every program on simv at once (in parallel with -j)
# make simulate_all_syn      <- run every program on syn_simv at once (in parallel with -j)

# ---- Executable Compilation ---- #
# make simv      <- compiles simv from the TESTBENCH and SOURCES
# make syn_simv  <- compiles syn_simv from TESTBENCH and SYNTH_FILES
# make *.vg      <- synthesize modules in SOURCES for use in syn_simv
# make slack     <- grep the slack status of any synthesized modules

# ---- Program Memory Compilation ---- #
# NOTE: programs to run are in the programs/ directory
# make programs/<my_program>.mem  <- compiles a program to a RISC-V memory file for running on the processor
# make compile_all                <- compile every program at once (in parallel with -j)

# ---- Dump Files ---- #
# make <my_program>.dump  <- disassembles <my_program>.mem into .dump_x and .dump_abi RISC-V assembly files
# make *.debug.dump       <- for a .c program, creates dump files after compiling with a debug flag
# make programs/<my_program>.dump_x    <- numeric dump files use x0-x31 as register names
# make programs/<my_program>.dump_abi  <- abi dump files use the abi register names (sp, a0, etc.)
# make dump_all  <- create all dump files at once (in parallel with -j)

# ---- Verdi ---- #
# make <my_program>.verdi     <- run a program in verdi via simv
# make <my_program>.syn.verdi <- run a program in verdi via syn_simv

# ---- Visual Debugger ---- #
# make <my_program>.vis  <- run a program on the project 3 vtuber visual debugger!
# make vis_simv          <- compile the vtuber executable from VTUBER and SOURCES

# ---- Cleanup ---- #
# make clean            <- remove per-run files and compiled executable files
# make nuke             <- remove all files created from make rules
# make clean_run_files  <- remove per-run output files
# make clean_exe        <- remove compiled executable files
# make clean_synth      <- remove generated synthesis files
# make clean_output     <- remove the entire output/ directory
# make clean_programs   <- remove program memory and dump files

# Credits:
# VeriSimpleV was adapted by Jielun Tan for RISC-V from the original 470 VeriSimple Alpha language processor
# however I cannot find the original authors or the major editors of the project :/
# so to everyone I can't credit: thank you!
# the current layout of the Makefile was made by Ian Wrzesinski in 2023
# VeriSimpleV has also been edited by at least:
# Nevil Pooniwala, Xueyang Liu, Cassie Jones, James Connolly

#   3. runs ./simv +MEMORY=programs/sampler.mem +WRITEBACK=output/sampler.wb +PIPELINE=output/sampler.ppln > output/sampler.out
#   4. which creates the sampler.out, sampler.wb, and sampler.ppln files in output/
# the same can be done for synthesis by doing 'make sampler.syn.out'
